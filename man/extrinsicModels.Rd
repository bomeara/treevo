column per state}

\item{timefrompresent}{which time slice in the tree}

\item{params}{describes input paramaters for the model.

column per state}

\value{
A matrix of values representing character displacement from a single
time step in the tree.

A matrix of values representing character displacement from a single
time step in the tree.

\description{
Functions describing various models of 'extrinsive' evolution (i.e. evolutionary processes
dependent on factors extrinsic to the evolving lineage, such as environmental change, or
other evolving lineages that interact with the lineage in question (competitors, predators, etc).

This function describes a model of extrinsic character evolution.  Character
values of a focal taxon depend on values of closest relatives on the tree
}
\details{
The following extrinsic models are:

This function describes a model of no extrinsic character evolution
