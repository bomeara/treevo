\usage{
autoregressiveIntrinsicTimeSlices(params, states, timefrompresent)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{describes input paramaters for the model.
\code{autoregressiveIntrinsicTimeSlices} params = sd-1 (sigma-1),
attractor-1 (character mean-1), attraction-1 (alpha-1), time threshold-1,
sd-2 (sigma-2), attractor-2 (character mean-2), attraction-2 (alpha-2), time
threshold-2}

\item{states}{vector of states for each taxon}

\item{timefrompresent}{which time slice in the tree}
}
\value{
A matrix of values representing character displacement from a single
time step in the tree.
}
\description{
This function describes a model of intrinsic character evolution. New
character values are generated after one time step via a discrete-time OU
process with differing means, sigma, and attraction over time
}
\details{
In the TimeSlices models, time threshold units are in time before present
(i.e., 65 could be 65 MYA). The last time threshold should be 0.
