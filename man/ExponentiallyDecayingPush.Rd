\title{Extrinsic Character Evolution Models}
\usage{
ExponentiallyDecayingPush(params, selfstates, otherstates, timefrompresent)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{describes input paramaters for the model.
\code{ExponentiallyDecayingPush} params = sd, maximum force, half distance}

\item{selfstates}{vector of states for each taxon}

\item{otherstates}{matrix of character states, one row per taxon and once
column per state}

\item{timefrompresent}{which time slice in the tree}
}
\value{
A matrix of values representing character displacement from a single
time step in the tree.
}
\description{
This function describes a model of extrinsic character evolution.  Character
values of a focal taxon pushes away harder from other taxa with like values;
"push" exponentially decays as the values become less similar
