## TreEvo
# R Package for Estimating Trait Evolution Parameter using Approximate Bayesian Computation.

TreEvo (case-sensitive) is an R Package for doing phylogenetic comparative method analyses of trait evolution, with a flexible framework for users to define their own novel models of trait evolution, involving both 'intrinsic' and 'extrinsic' factors (respective to the evolving lineage).

Currently, TreEvo is adapted only for univariate, continuous traits.

This work was initially written by Barb Banbury and Brian O'Meara, and since July 2017, has been largely editted and maintained by David W. Bapst. The software is open-source licensed under the GNU General Protection License (most recent version).

CRAN submission is coming soon. The latest pre-release version of TreEvo can be found at github:

	https://github.com/bomeara/treevo
	
You can install the latest stable development version using the R function install_github in the package 'devtools':

	devtools::install_github("bomeara/treevo")
	
More experimental, less stable versions can be found on other branches of this github repo.
